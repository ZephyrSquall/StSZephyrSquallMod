# Zephyr Squall Mod

This is a sandbox I'm using to learn mod creation for Slay the Spire, by creating cards and mechanics to implement Zephyr Squall, a character I've designed to represent myself online.

This is primarily for my own learning. It's possible I will eventually complete this character and release him for anyone to play as, but this character may also remain unfinished forever as I use what I learned here to work on other characters. 

This was created using BasicMod's template and tutorials. https://github.com/Alchyr/BasicMod/wiki
