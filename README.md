# Zephyr Squall Character Mod

## Installation
As this mod is still incomplete, it has not yet been uploaded to the Steam Workshop. Until then, this mod can be installed directly from this GitHub page by following these instructions.
- Subscribe to [ModTheSpire](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1605060445) (not ModTheSpire++), [BaseMod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1605833019), and [StSLib](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1609158507) from the Steam Workshop. These are necessary for this mod to work.
- In the Releases tab on the right side of this page, click the latest release to go to its page.
- Scroll to the "Assets" section of the latest release and download the `ZephyrSquallMod.jar` file. Ignore the source code files.
- Locate your `SlayTheSpire` folder. Where this folder is located depends on where you install Steam games. If you use the default location, it should be located somewhere like `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire`. If you are unsure where this folder is, you should be able to find it by right-clicking Slay the Spire in your Steam library and choosing Manage > Browse Local Files.
- Create a folder called `mods` within your `SlayTheSpire` folder. Put the `ZephyrSquallMod.jar` file in this `mods` folder (so if you have the default install location, it should look something like `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire/mods/ZephyrSquallMod.jar`).
- Launch Slay the Spire. You should see a prompt that lets you choose to "Play with Mods". Afterwards, you will see a window listing all the mods you've installed. Make sure you select "BaseMod", "StSLib", and "Zephyr Squall", as well as any other mods you want to use, then click "Play".

Keep in mind Zephyr is still in testing. His cards may be bugged and not do what they say they do, or interact incorrectly with other mechanics. It's possible the game may crash. Even if his cards work correctly, they may be poorly balanced, potentially making some of his mechanics significantly stronger than others, or making Zephyr overall significantly stronger or weaker than the base game characters. If you encounter any bugs or have any feedback for Zephyr's balance, please let me know!

Zephyr's card pool is also incomplete, currently only having roughly 70% as many unique cards as base game characters. This means each individual card is slightly more likely to appear in runs right now, which can make it easier to search for specific cards. The intent is that playtesting will reveal which of Zephyr's mechanics don't have enough support, so the remaining 30% of cards can be designed with his shortcomings in mind.

## Character Overview

Zephyr Squall is a wind dragon who values knowledge above all else. He hoards books in his own personal library, which has made him very knowledgeable. In battle, he carefully plans his actions while waiting for the perfect opportunity, then he uses his wind magic to aid himself and hinder his foes to strike quickly and decisively.

Zephyr is very studious and likes to consider every possible option, represented by having lots of powerful draw effects. He also has many effects that get stronger the more cards you have in hand. Several of Zephyr's cards have the "Well Read" mechanic, which causes an additional effect to occur if the card is played while your hand is full.

Zephyr also attacks very quickly. The majority of Zephyr's Attack cards don't have high damage values, but make up for it by hitting multiple times. Some of Zephyr's cards have effects that care about how many times you attack, which scale well with his multi-hit Attack cards.

None of Zephyr's cards provide him with a way to gain additional energy. Instead, Zephyr has a mechanic called "Streamline" which reduces a card's cost until it is played. If a Streamlined card isn't required on the current turn, energy could be saved on a later turn by not playing that card now and letting it cycle again. Some cards also have an additional effect if they are Streamlined.

Zephyr can also take advantage of the wind to move incredibly quickly. Several cards give Zephyr a new resource called "Tailwind". If you end the turn with 10 or more Tailwind, you immediately use it to take an extra turn.

As a librarian, Zephyr is also able to take advantage of books to recall important techniques exactly when he needs them. Some of Zephyr's cards lets him "Record" other cards, which generates a new Book card in your hand and places the Recorded cards inside it. Book cards have Retain, Exhaust, and return the Recorded cards to your hand when played. None of Zephyr's other cards have Retain, so using Books is the only way to keep a card in hand between turns, which can be useful as some cards are more effective on particular turns when certain conditions are met. Zephyr can also take advantage of the Books without playing them by Recording less useful cards so they stop cycling in his deck, or by using the retained Books to start each turn with a bigger hand which makes Well Read and similar effects easier to take advantage of.
